Tapestry Service Cache is an addon library for Tapestry 5 that allows you to add simple, annotation based caching to
your project. Due to the modular, plug and play nature of Tapestry 5, you can just add this library as a dependency
and add some annotations to your service classes to make your services cachable!

The easiest way to use this library is to use maven. Add this to your pom:

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ciaranwood</groupId>
    <artifactId>tapestry-service-cache</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>

Version 1.0 is compatible with Tapestry 5.1, version 2.0.1 is compatible with Tapestry 5.2.
